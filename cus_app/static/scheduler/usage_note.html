 <center><h1>POC Scheduler Usage </h1> </center>


<p>The standard duty period starts from Monday morning 00:00:00 and finishes Sunday night 23:59:59.</p>

<ul class='lwide'>
    <li class='lwide'>
        To sign up for the period you like to be a POC, select your name from the dropdown menu
        of the first column of the period, then click "Update." You can choose more than one
        period, and submit all by clicking any of the "Update" buttons.
    </li>
    <li class='lwide'>
        If you cannot be a POC for a standard duty period, you can modify the time span of the period.
        <ul>
            <li>To modify the starting time, the row before the period must be still open.</li>
            <li>Similarly, if you like to modify the ending time, the row after the period 
                must be still open.</li>
            <li>After modifying the period (and 'sign-up' for the period), click "Update." 
                Adjacent period(s) will be adjusted automatically.</li>
            <li>You can split a row into two shorter periods by clicking "Split" button.</li>
            <li>Note, if the time span is non-standard, the row is marked by a 
                <span style='color:rgb(255,153,255,1.2)'>magenta</span> background.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li class='lwide'>
        If you like to remove an open row, click the "Delete" button.
    </li>
    <li class='lwide'>
        If there is a gap in the period with adjacent rows, the submission won't
        be completed and the page will display a 'Warning' note. The row with the wrong time
        period will be marked by the <span style='color:red;'>red</span> background color. 
        Note that, occasionally a row one before or one after are marked by red background color,
        instead of the row with the non-standard period.
    </li>
    <li class='lwide'>
        Although you signed up for a certain period, if you find out that you cannot 
        do the duty in that period, click the "Unlock" button to re-open the period.
    </li>
</ul>
