If there are multiple revisions of the same obsid on the list:

<ol>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    Different revisions of the same obsid are indicated by the same color
    marker on the "OBSID.revision" column.
    </li>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    If "<span style='color:chocolate;'>Multiple Revisions Open</span>"
    is listed in the "Note column," the obsid has multiple
    revisions that are still open. Please verify all earlier revisions before verifying the latest one.
    </li>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    If "<span style='color:darkorchid;'>Higher Rev # Was Already Signed Off</span>"
    is listed in the "Note column," the obsid has a newer entry already signed off. 
    Please verify all versions of the obsid on the table, as the latest one (which was already signed off) supersedes all previous revisions.
    If an earlier version of the obsid contains unsigned edits which are no longer desired, consult the "Discard" button.
    </li>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    If "<span style='color:red;'>Large Coordinate Shift</span>"
    is listed in the "Note column," then the Right Ascension and Declination coordinates were collectively shifter by more than 8 arc minutes.
    </li>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    If "<span style='color:darkcyan;'>New Comment</span>"
    is listed in the "Note column," then a new comment has been listed with relevant details to the revision.
    </li>
    If "<span style='color:forestgreen;'>On Approved List</span>"
    is listed in the "Note column," then this Obsid is already approved by Usint and so that approval is assumed to still be given once the revision is completed.
    </li>
    <li style='padding-bottom:10px;'>
    You can clear any "out-of-date" entries
    by clicking the "Discard" button, even if the general, ACIS, ACIS SI Mode,
    or HRC SI Mode edits columns are not signed off yet. Any of the unsigned
    column entries will be recorded as "N/A" in the database.
